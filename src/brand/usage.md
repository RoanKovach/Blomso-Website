# Logo & brand usage rules

## Clear space

The minimum clear space around the logo mark is equal to the **height of one leaf** on all sides. No text, borders, or other graphical elements may enter this zone.

```
        ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │         ↕ 1 leaf        │
        │    ↔  🌿🌿🌿  ↔        │
        │         ↕ 1 leaf        │
        └─────────────────────────┘
```

When using the lockup (mark + wordmark), measure clear space from the outermost edge of the wordmark, not the mark alone.

## Minimum size

| Format  | Min width |
| ------- | --------- |
| Print   | 24 mm     |
| Screen  | 32 px     |
| Favicon | 16 × 16 px (mark only, simplified) |

## Background rules

### Preferred backgrounds

| Background          | Logo version          |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| White / light gray  | Full-color mark       |
| Dark (#1A2414+)     | White lockup variant  |
| Brand green (≥ 800) | White mark            |

### Contrast requirement

The logo must maintain a **minimum 4.5 : 1** contrast ratio against its background (WCAG AA). Use the white variant on any background where full-color leaves would fall below this threshold.

## Do / Don't

### Do

- Use the provided SVG or high-res PNG — never screenshot or rasterize from the website.
- Maintain original proportions; scale uniformly.
- Place on solid or very subtle gradient backgrounds.
- Use the white lockup variant on dark surfaces and photography.

### Don't

- Rotate, skew, or apply perspective transforms to the logo.
- Recolor individual leaves or swap green shades.
- Place on busy photography or patterned backgrounds without a solid scrim.
- Add drop shadows, outlines, glows, or other effects.
- Crop or clip any part of the mark.
- Set the logo smaller than the minimum sizes above.
- Pair the logo with typefaces outside the approved type pairs (see `type.ts`).
